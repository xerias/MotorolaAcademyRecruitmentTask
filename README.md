I always was a self-taught person. But I have never had enough time and motivation to focus on programming. If i could have chosen again my studies
direction, Iwould have definitely decide to study robotics and programming. Beside java, i also tried C/C++ and VBA. Although my current Position
is hardly connected to programming, In order to be efficient at data-sorting and filtering i have written my own advanced macros.
Programming is something which was always in my head. I have even a modest codewars profile https://www.codewars.com/users/Nariox. Nowadays I am searching an opportunity to improve significantly programming skills because I am very into it and would like to start my next Job
as a junior backend developer. I hope to being given opportunity speak a bit more about it :)
